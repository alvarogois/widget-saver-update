# widget-saver-update

Simple update to the original Widget Saver WordPress plugin, [suggested by Redzephyr here](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/is-killing-layout-of-widget-page-in-wp-38).

The original zorgbargle's plugin can be found on [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-saver/).

The widget saver lets you save widget configurations, so that you can have different configurations with different themes, without having to move all your widgets each time you want to test a different configuration.

This update deals with recent changes in WordPress widgets UI.

## What I've done
I just typed Redzephyr' suggestions and uploaded it here, so everybody can still use it.

I've tested it with 3.9 and 4.0 and it seems to work just fine.

## Help
If you find something wrong with it, please let me know so that it can be fixed (or shutdown if necessary).
