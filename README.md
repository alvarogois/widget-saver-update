widget-saver-update
===================

Simple update to the original Widget Saver WordPress plugin, suggested by Redzephyr here: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/is-killing-layout-of-widget-page-in-wp-38

The original zorgbargle plugin can be found in the WordPress.org site (http://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-saver/).

I've just typed Redzephyr' suggestions and uploaded it here, so everybody can still use it.

If you find something wrong with it, please let me know so that it can be fixed (or shut off if necessary).
